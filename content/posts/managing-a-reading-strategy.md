Reading list. Digital junk pile. List of tabs. [One Tab](https://www.one-tab.com/). [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/). [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/). That stack of books on your bookshelf, kitchen table, living room table, in a series of 6 stacked boxes in your basement. [Papers](https://www.papersapp.com/). [Mendeley](https://www.google.com/search?q=mendeley+app&oq=mendeley+app&aqs=chrome..69i57.1499j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). That voice of residual guilt nagging you. Amazon wish list. Amazon Kindle library full of aspirations. Stacks of papers strewn about your desk.

Enough assorted guilt. If you're like me then you already know what I'm talking about: the _indefatigable_ list of things you'd like to read and learn, be inspired by, be challenged by, enjoy, take notes on, write a rebuttal to, mine for new things to read, etc.

I fancy myself a bit of a lifelong learner. Maybe even a researcher of various things that interest me. I'll get on long binges where I chow down on everything I can think of related to [functional reactive programming](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1028250/what-is-functional-reactive-programming), [stoic philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/), [management philosophy inspired by process flow and queueing theory](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation-ebook/dp/B007TKU0O0), [intuitionism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism/), the [history of the East India Trading Company](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Corporation-That-Changed-World-Multinational/dp/0745325238), more [emotionally-aware mentorship](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Happiness-Games-Practices-Motivate/dp/1119268680), and [pointless topology](https://www.amazon.com/Spaces-Cambridge-Studies-Advanced-Mathematics/dp/0521337798).

These can be incredibly productive and seriously widen my worldview about a topic in a deep and enriching way. Or they can be a pile of anxiety and confusion, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

My suspicion is that I'm not alone in this.
-------------------------------------------

It's super frustrating! I collect these digital knick knacks and breadcrumb trails because at least at some point in my life I felt that _this sort of experience is worth the time!_ Which mostly goes to show that I wildly undervalue and overestimate my time.

But that means that as these piles get deeper and wider that they start to be measured in missed opportunities. Some are opportunities which I've reasonably deprioritized, but others are still good, important ones that have just been lost to the waves of time.

**I want to be better at creating, reviewing, and coordinating my reading strategy. **By which I mean the intentional choice to invest this much time in this spread of topics because they're _right_ for whatever ends I'm holding on to.

I'm not very good at this. It's expensive and challenging to even just get a sense for the places I could investigate. In the past I've collected huge lists and largely failed to keep up with them. Instead, I tend to be somewhat significantly at the mercy of what has come to mind recently or what's persistent enough that I can't ignore it. In these ways this isn't even _my strategy_ but instead my allergic reaction to the marketing strategies of these content creators.

Side note for the GTD crowd
---------------------------

There are lots of obvious connections from this pain to GTD, but I've personally found a lot of them to be failures so far. "Read what's important to you" is a giant project with many hudreds of potential next actions which I'm continuously renegotiating. You certainly _can_ use GTD to be a more present and dilligent researcher, but when I say **reading strategy** I mean something slightly different. In GTD terms, I want to become structured in how I plan and consider this entire "research" project.

So how do you manage your reading strategy?
-------------------------------------------

I know I'm not very good at it, but maybe you are. Maybe there are whole different approaches to this which help the amateur researcher to get really in sync with their interests. Or maybe it's just honestly a pretty difficult thing to get _just right_.

I'm planning on writing a few more posts exploring this pain and what's worked and not worked for me. Ultimately, it's a problem I'd like to find a decent solution to.
